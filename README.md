About Interset
----------------

Originally, it was a tool for interactive redescription set exploration. Combining it with CLUS-RM algorithm (algorithm for searching for redescriptions) we created an effective interactive environment for searching, browsing and deep analysis of sets of redescriptions. 

This tool was developed as a part of requrement for obtaining a Master’s degree in Computer Science and Mathematics at the Faculty of Science, Department of Mathematics, Zagreb, Croatia.
